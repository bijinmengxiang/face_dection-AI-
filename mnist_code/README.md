These are codes about mnist!
The first which named mnist it's official code.
The second which named minst_bymyself it's based on LeNet5 neural network.
But maybe a little different between my version and the official version.

If that it's your first time to learning about learning machine, 
I extremely recommend you can bulid the neural network word by word.
